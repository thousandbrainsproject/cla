        # Thousand Brains Project - Contributor License Agreement ("CLA") v1

        Thank you for your interest in contributing to the Thousand Brains Project ("TBP"). The TBP is very interested in receiving Your Contribution (defined below). In order to participate, we need to confirm how the rights in Your Contribution will be handled. Following the practices of other open source communities, TBP requests that you grant TBP a license, as indicated below, to the intellectual property rights in Your Contributions. TBP requires that you have a Contributor License Agreement ("CLA") on file prior to using any of Your Contributions. This helps us ensure that the intellectual property embodied within TBP remains unencumbered for use by the whole of the community. This CLA includes other terms as well and is for your protection as a Contributor as well as the protection of TBP and its users; it does not change your rights to use Your Contributions for any other purpose.

        Please read the following document carefully before signing and keep a copy for your records.

        ## Contributor License Agreement (“CLA”)

        By signing this CLA, electronically or otherwise, You are entering into a binding legal agreement between You and the TBP, by which You accept and agree to the following terms and conditions for Your present and future Contributions submitted to TBP, in consideration for the potential inclusion of Your Contributions in TBP. Except for the license and rights granted herein to TBP and downstream recipients of software distributed or otherwise made available by TBP, You reserve all right, title, and interest in and to Your Contributions.

        ### 1. Definitions

        1.1 "You" (or "Your") shall mean: (i) the individual executing this CLA, if the individual is making the Contribution on their personal behalf; or (ii) the copyright owner or legal entity authorized by the copyright owner that is making this Agreement with TBP, if the individual executing this CLA is making the Contribution on behalf of the copyright owner or authorized legal entity. For legal entities, the entity making a Contribution and all other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common control with that entity are considered to be a single Contributor. For the purposes of this definition, "control" means (a) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or otherwise, or (b) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the outstanding shares, or (c) beneficial ownership of such entity.

        1.2 "Contribution" means any original work of authorship (including software, documentation, or other material), including any modifications or additions to an existing work, that is intentionally submitted by You to TBP for inclusion in, or documentation of, any of the products owned or managed by TBP (the "Work"). For the purposes of this definition, "submitted" means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent to TBP or its representatives, including but not limited to communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems, and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, TBP for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise designated in writing by You as "Not a Contribution."

        ### 2. Grant of Copyright License

        Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, You hereby grant to TBP and downstream recipients of software distributed by TBP a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable copyright license under all of Your copyrights worldwide, including without limitation the rights to copy, reproduce, combine, modify, prepare derivative works of, publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute and otherwise make available Your Contributions and such combinations, modifications and derivative works (a “Work Based On Your Contribution”).

        ### 3. Grant of Patent License

        Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, You hereby grant to TBP and to downstream recipients of software distributed by TBP a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made, use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Contribution and the Work, where such license applies only to those patent claims existing as of the effective date of this CLA and licensable by You that are necessarily infringed by Your Contribution(s) alone or by combination of Your Contribution(s) with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If any entity institutes patent litigation against You or any other entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that your Contribution, or the Work to which you have contributed, constitutes direct or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses granted to that entity under this Agreement for that Contribution or Work shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.

        ### 4. Representations

        4.1 You represent that You are legally entitled to grant the above license under this CLA, whether on behalf of Yourself (if you are an individual person) or on behalf of the entity on whose behalf You are authorized to enter into this Agreement (if You are acting on behalf of an entity). If You are an individual and Your employer(s) has rights to intellectual property that You create that includes Your Contributions, You represent that You have received permission to make Contributions on behalf of that employer, that Your employer has waived in writing such rights for Your Contributions to TBP, or that Your employer has executed a separate CLA with TBP.

        4.2 You represent that each of Your Contributions is solely Your original creation and work of authorship (see section 6 for submissions on behalf of others). You represent that Your Contribution does not include any third party materials or that your Contribution includes complete details of any third-party materials and all applicable license(s) or other restrictions (including, but not limited to, related patents, copyrights and trademarks) of which you are personally aware and which are associated with or cover any part of Your Contributions. You represent that to Your knowledge the Contribution does not contain any malicious code or information intended to do harm.

        ### 5. Support

        You are not expected to provide support for Your Contributions, except to the extent You desire to provide support. You may provide support for free, for a fee, or not at all. Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing herein or otherwise, You provide Your Contributions on an "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

        ### 6. Work from Others

        Should You wish to submit work that is not Your original creation, You may submit it to TBP separately from any Contribution, identifying the complete details of its source and of any license or other restriction (including, but not limited to, related patents, trademarks, and license agreements) of which you are personally aware, and conspicuously marking the work as "Submitted on behalf of a third-party: [named here]".

        ### 7. Changes

        You agree to notify the TBP of any facts or circumstances of which you become aware that would make these representations inaccurate in any respect.

        ### 8. Successors and Assigns

        The licenses and other rights and obligations in this CLA shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the respective successors and assigns of You and TBP.
